# Limitations of model 
Model can see past, future and billions of different outcomes of universe. This means if model giving you a wrong prediction, it's just because you are living in the wrong version of universe. Also it won't work if you have the wrong zodiac sign. For example if you are Cancer, then I suggest you to go play some dota instead of trying to use this model.
